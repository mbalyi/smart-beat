# Changelog

Release notes for every version. The release workflow publishes the section that matches the tag (`v1.0.0-beta.1` uses `## [1.0.0-beta.1]`) as the GitHub Release text, and the in-app update dialog shows it. Keep the headings exactly in this form.

## [Unreleased]

## [1.0.0-beta.1]

The first public beta of Smart Beat, a free tablature editor for macOS, Windows and Linux. Please report problems at https://github.com/mbalyi/smart-beat/issues or write to smart-beat@outlook.com.

- Opens, plays and edits Guitar Pro (GP3–GP8), MuseScore, MusicXML and MIDI files, with a mixer, practice tools (loops, Speed Trainer, metronome, count-in) and a fretboard, keyboard and drum-pad view.
- Saves to Guitar Pro 7, 5, 4 and 3 and to MuseScore; exports MusicXML, MIDI, alphaTex, ASCII tab, WAV and (on macOS) M4A.
- A tuner, and the choice of audio input in Settings (for example an audio interface with your guitar plugged in).
- Settings… in the macOS app menu (⌘,); on Windows and Linux it is in the Help menu (Ctrl+,).
- Help › Check for Updates…, plus a quiet automatic check at most once a day. Nothing is downloaded until you click **Download & Install**.
- Anonymous usage counters (which features are used, per day, with the app version, operating system and installer type; no identifier and nothing about your songs). Switch them off in Help › Settings…, which also deletes counts not sent yet.
- Help › About shows the contact address and a link to the source code. A "Built with" section on the start page thanks alphaTab and the other open-source projects behind Smart Beat.
- Licensing: the source code is available under the PolyForm Noncommercial License 1.0.0 (commercial use needs a separate agreement, see `COMMERCIAL-LICENSE.md`); the app is free under the End User License Agreement 1.0 (Dutch law, your local consumer rights kept).
- Fixed: stopping the tuner while macOS was still asking for the microphone left the microphone on.

Coming soon: AI features, starting with audio to tab (turn a recording into MIDI and tab).

This is a beta: back up songs you care about. Beta versions are not offered by the automatic update check, so download the next beta from the releases page.
