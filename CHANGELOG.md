# Changelog

Release notes for every version. The release workflow publishes the section that matches the tag (`v1.0.0-beta.1` uses `## [1.0.0-beta.1]`) as the GitHub Release text, and the in-app update dialog shows it. Keep the headings exactly in this form.

## [Unreleased]

- Plugin blocks now have independent audio and preset state, bypass immediately when plugins are switched off, and release their helpers when removed. Audio uses bounded shared-memory buffers with no callback allocations; synthetic-plugin tests exercise isolation and recovery in CI. Blocks cross to the helper in order and are taken back in order, so every block of a render callback gets plugin output instead of one in eight; missing or wrong-sized answers are skipped instead of stalling later blocks. Queued preset changes preserve undo order, and preset-load failures remain visible while audio continues with the last accepted settings. A preset you save is applied without waiting for the helper, so saving no longer holds the audio engine's lock, and a mono CLAP plugin now gets its own channel counts instead of a stereo guess.

- Third-party plugin hosting (VST3 and CLAP) as opt-in pedalboard blocks. Plugins are off by default, scanned from the standard folders, and each runs in its own helper process outside the app: the audio thread never waits (missed answers pass dry and recover in the background), the added latency (the plugin's own plus the measured handover, about one render callback) shows under the block in milliseconds, and Save settings stores the preset in the song (up to 4 MB).

## [1.0.0]

The first stable release of Smart Beat. It is the first public beta plus updated dependencies:

- Updated the Tauri runtime and plugins (including the updater), Radix UI, shadcn, lucide icons and the test tooling.

## [1.0.0-beta.1]

The first public beta of Smart Beat, a free tablature editor for macOS, Windows and Linux. Please report problems at https://github.com/mbalyi/smart-beat/issues or write to smart-beat@outlook.com.

- Opens, plays and edits Guitar Pro (GP3–GP8), MuseScore, MusicXML and MIDI files, with a mixer, practice tools (loops, Speed Trainer, metronome, count-in) and a fretboard, keyboard and drum-pad view.
- Saves to Guitar Pro 7, 5, 4 and 3 and to MuseScore; exports MusicXML, MIDI, alphaTex, ASCII tab, WAV and (on macOS) M4A.
- A tuner, and the choice of audio input in Settings (for example an audio interface with your guitar plugged in).
- Settings… in the macOS app menu (⌘,); on Windows and Linux it is in the Help menu (Ctrl+,).
- Help › Check for Updates…, plus a quiet automatic check at most once a day. Nothing is downloaded until you click **Download & Install**.
- Anonymous usage counters (which features are used, per day, with the app version, operating system and installer type; no identifier and nothing about your songs). Switch them off in Help › Settings…, which also deletes counts not sent yet.
- Help › About shows the contact address and a link to the source code. A "Built with" section on the start page thanks alphaTab and the other open-source projects behind Smart Beat.
- Licensing: the source code is available under the PolyForm Noncommercial License 1.0.0 (commercial use needs a separate agreement, see `COMMERCIAL-LICENSE.md`); the app is free under the End User License Agreement 1.0 (Dutch law, your local consumer rights kept).
- Fixed: stopping the tuner while macOS was still asking for the microphone left the microphone on.

Coming soon: AI features, starting with audio to tab (turn a recording into MIDI and tab).

This is a beta: back up songs you care about. Beta versions are not offered by the automatic update check, so download the next beta from the releases page.
